# HR_Excel_Dashboard
I created an interactive Excel HR dashboard with pivot tables and charts to analyse attrition rates, calculated attrition rates using advanced Excel functions, and summarised the data with pivot tables. Additionally, I enhanced the dashboard's interactivity with slicers and visualised data across various components.
